The Target RunTime System (or TargetRTS for short) is a C++ library that is used by the code that is generated by {$product.name$}. When building the realtime application from the generated code, it links with a TargetRTS library that has been prebuilt for the platform (hardware, operating system etc) on which the realtime application will run.

The TargetRTS provides C++ implementations for the concepts of the [Art language](../art-lang). The [APIs](https://rtist.hcldoc.com/help/topic/com.hcl.xtools.umldt.rt.targetrts.doc.isv/html/index.html) of these implementations are used by the generated code, but also by the embedded C++ code that you write inside the Art files. This documentation serves the following purposes:

* Provide a general understanding of how the TargetRTS is structured and how it implements important concepts from the Art language.
* Document the [C++ APIs](https://rtist.hcldoc.com/help/topic/com.hcl.xtools.umldt.rt.targetrts.doc.isv/html/index.html) that you can use in C++ code snippets within an Art file.
* Describe how to build the TargetRTS for a new target platform, including ways to customize it as required.
