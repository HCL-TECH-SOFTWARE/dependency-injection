An Art file is primarily edited using its textual syntax in the [text editor](art-editor.md). However, many parts of the Art language also has a graphical syntax which can be shown (and to some extent also edited) from [graphical diagrams](diagrams.md). Visual Studio Code and Eclipse Theia also provides a few views that provide value for Art, such as the [Outline view](outline-view.md) and the [Type Hierachy view](type-hierarchy.md). These views do not support any editing, but provide useful overview and navigation possibilities.
