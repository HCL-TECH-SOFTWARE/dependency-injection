{$product.name$} lets you create stateful, event-driven realtime applications in C++.

It runs as an extension of Visual Studio Code or Eclipse Theia. Follow the [installation instructions](../installing) for installing it.

{$product.name$} supports [the Art language](../art-lang) which is an extension of the C++ language. It provides high-level concepts useful when designing stateful, event-driven realtime applications, such as capsules, state machines and protocols. It is a textual language, but also provides a graphical notation that includes class, state and structure diagrams.

{$product.name$} translates Art files into efficient C++ code which can be compiled on any target system. The generated code makes use of the [Target RunTime System](../target-rts) which is a C++ library that implements the concepts of the Art language.
