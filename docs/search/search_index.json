Follow the installation instructions for installing it.</p> <p>RTist in Code supports the Art language which is an extension of the C++ language. It provides high-level concepts useful when designing stateful, event-driven realtime applications, such as capsules, state machines and protocols. It is a textual language, but also provides a graphical notation that includes class, state and structure diagrams.</p> <p>RTist in Code translates Art files into efficient C++ code which can be compiled on any target system. The generated code makes use of the Target RunTime System which is a C++ library that implements the concepts of the Art language.</p> <p>Watch this video to get an overview of how RTist in Code uses the Art language for implementing stateful, event-driven realtime applications.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#art-history","title":"Art History","text":"<p>The Art language as implemented in RTist in Code builds on a foundation with a long history in industry. In the early 1990s the Canadian company ObjecTime Limited developed a language called ROOM to address the challenges of building realtime applications consisting of communicating state machines. ROOM introduced concepts such as capsules, protocols and ports and was first implemented in the tool ObjecTime Developer. This tool got adopted in a wide range of industrial domains for example telecom and embedded systems development.</p> <p>In 2000 ObjectTime was acquired by Rational Software and ObjecTime Developer was merged with Rational Rose, a UML modeling tool. The result was Rational Rose RealTime (Rose RT). At the same time many of the ROOM language concepts made its way into the, by then, new modeling language called UML-RealTime.</p> <p>In 2003 Rational Software was acquired by IBM which at the time was investing heavily in the Eclipse platform. As a result work started to create an Eclipse-based tool as the successor of Rose RT. This new product got the name Rational Software Architect RealTime Edition (RSARTE) and was first released in 2007.</p> <p>In 2016 HCL entered a partnership with IBM, which led to a rebranded version of RSARTE called HCL RTist.</p> <p>Work on RTist in Code began in 2020 with the aim of supporting other IDEs than Eclipse. As part of this effort a textual language syntax, Art, was developed. Hence it's fair to describe the Art language as a new syntax for concepts that have a rather old history and have already been used in the industry for more than 30 years. It should also be mentioned that the Target RunTime System used in RTist in Code is the same as is used in HCL RTist and IBM RSARTE. In fact, the implementation of this C++ library started with ObjectTime Developer and has since then been gradually extended and modernized.</p>"},{"location":"settings/","title":"Settings","text":"<p>RTist in Code provides several settings that can be used for configuring many aspects of how it works.

This is because in this case events are simply delegated from one capsule to another.</p> <pre><code>capsule Top {    \n    part ping : Pinger, pong : Ponger; \n    connect ping.p1 with pong.p2; // ART_0026 (same port conjugations but should be different)\n\n    statemachine {\n        state t21;\n        initial -&gt; t21;\n    };\n};\n\ncapsule Inner {\n    service behavior port p : PROTO;\n\n    statemachine {\n        state State;\n        initial -&gt; State;\n    };\n};\ncapsule Pinger {    \n    service port p1~ : PROTO;  \n    part inner : Inner;\n    connect p1 with inner.p; // ART_0026 (different port conjugations but should be same)\n\n    statemachine {\n        state State1;\n        initial -&gt; State1;\n    };\n};\n\ncapsule Ponger {\n    service behavior port p2~ : PROTO;    \n\n    statemachine {\n        state State1;                    \n        initial -&gt; State1;\n    };\n};\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Here we see that both connectors are invalid.

By event-driven we mean that these objects communicate with each other by sending events, which can cause their state machines to transition from one state to another. </p> <p>The Art language provides high-level concepts not directly found in the C++ language. All these high-level concepts are transformed into C++ code by the Art compiler. Generated code uses a run-time library known as the TargetRTS (Target RunTime System).

C++ is also used for declaring types, variables, functions etc. As a rule of thumb, Art uses C++ for everything where C++ is a good fit, and only provides new language concepts where no appropriate constructs exist in C++.

A capsule is like a C++ class, but with a few differences and extensions. A C++ class is passive in the sense that a caller can access its public member functions and variables at any time. Hence a C++ object always executes in the context of the caller, and when a member function is called, the caller is blocked until it returns. A capsule, however, is active and has its own execution context. This means that we never call a capsule member function or access a capsule member variable from outside the capsule itself. Instead we communicate with the capsule by sending events to it. Each capsule has a queue of events it has received and the events will be dispatched to the capsule one by one. The sender of the event is not blocked, as the event will be handled by the capsule asynchronously when it is later dispatched.</p> <p>The picture below shows 3 capsule instances each holding a queue with events that have been received, but not yet dispatched. Note that this picture is conceptual. In a real implementation several performance optimizations are applied, for example it's common to let a single thread drive more than one capsule instance, and several capsule instances can share a common event queue. But from a conceptual point of view each capsule has its own queue of events that are waiting to be dispatched to it. Events have a priority which determines how they are ordered in the queue. Events with high priority are placed before events with lower priority, and if two events have the same priority they are ordered according to when they arrive.</p> <p></p> <p>A capsule may have ports. A port is typed by a protocol which defines the events that may be sent in to the port (these are known as in-events), as well as the events the capsule itself may send out through the port for others to receive (these are called out-events). Ports can be used both for internal and external communication. A port used for external communication is called a service port. Together, the service ports constitute the communication interface of the capsule, and decide what \"services\" the capsule provides for other capsules to use.</p> <p></p> <p>A simple capsule which only handles a small number of events, may be able to handle all these events using a single state machine. However, when new ports are added (or new events in protocols typing existing ports), the capsule interface grows and the state machine has to grow with it, since there will be more events for it to handle. Eventually a point is reached where it will not be practical for a capsule to handle any more events in its own state machine, because it has grown too large or complex. If not before, this is the time to define a composite structure for the capsule. </p> <p>A composite structure is created by decomposing a capsule using capsule parts. A capsule part (or, for simplicity, just part) is typed by another capsule and is a way for a capsule to delegate some of its responsibilities to other capsules. Such a decomposition is purely an implementation detail that is not visible from the outside of the capsule. When you send an event to a capsule you cannot know if the capsule will handle the event itself, or if it will forward the event to another capsule typing one of its capsule parts. The ability to decompose a capsule into parts is important for managing complexity. When a capsule has grown too big and complex you can decompose it into capsule parts without changing the communication interface of the capsule. </p> <p>Ports of capsules typing capsule parts are connected to each other by means of connectors. A connector is a conceptual construct for showing how events are routed in the internal structure of a capsule. At run-time connectors don't exist, and ports are directly connected to each other. Because of this, it's not mandatory to use connectors. You can also choose to dynamically connect (and disconnect) ports at run-time. Although this provides for more flexibility, it has the drawback of making it impossible to statically visualize the communication paths of a capsule. Ports that connect statically to other ports via connectors are called wired ports. Ports that are connected dynamically without use of static connectors are called unwired ports. </p> <p>The picture below shows the structure of a capsule <code>Top</code> which consists of two capsule parts <code>ping</code> and <code>pong</code> each holding a capsule instance (a <code>Pinger</code> capsule and a <code>Ponger</code> capsule respectively). The connector between the wired ports <code>p</code> on these capsules makes it possible for these capsules to communicate with each other. Communication can also happen using the unwired ports <code>q1</code> and <code>q2</code> if they are connected at run-time. The picture also shows that the capsule <code>Ponger</code> is further decomposed using a capsule part <code>inner</code>. All events sent to port <code>p</code> of <code>Ponger</code> will be further routed to port <code>i</code> of the <code>Internal</code> capsule. </p> <p></p> <p>Regardless if ports are statically connected by connectors (wired ports), or dynamically connected at run-time (unwired ports), they must be compatible with each other. This means that the out-events of one port must match the in-events of the other port, for the ports to be possible to connect. This constraint ensures that events are never lost when traveling between two connected ports. To make it possible to describe the events that may travel between two connected ports using a single protocol, one of the ports can be declared as conjugated. For a conjugated port the meaning of in-events and out-events are swapped, so that the in-events are the events that may be sent out through the port, and the out-events are the ports that may be sent to the port. In the picture above port <code>q1</code> is non-conjugated () while port <code>q2</code> is conjugated ().</p> <p>Both capsule parts and ports may have multiplicity. You can think about a capsule part with multiplicity &gt; 1 as an array that holds capsule instances at run-time. In the same way you can think about a port with multiplicity &gt; 1 as an array that holds connections to port instances at run-time. The multiplicity of ports and parts must match when connecting two ports with each other. Once again, this constraint ensures that events will not be lost when traveling between the connected ports at run-time. The picture below shows a capsule with a part and a port that both have multiplicity &gt; 1. In structure diagrams such parts and ports are shown as \"stacked boxes\".</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to regular C++ member functions a capsule may have a state machine as its behavior. A state machine describes how an instance of the capsule may move between different states through its life-time. A transition that connects a source state with a target state may be triggered when an event from a capsule's event queue is dispatched. Several conditions must hold true for the transition to trigger. For example, the event must match a trigger that specifies the expected type of event and the port on which it was received. It's also possible to associate a boolean guard condition with the transition and/or with the trigger which must be true for the transition to trigger. A transition may have an effect, which is a piece of C++ code that executes when the transition gets triggered.</p> <p>The picture below shows a state machine containing three states and three transitions. The presence of transition guard code is shown with a yellow dot and the presence of transition effect code is shown with a blue dot. Both these are C++ code snippets that are embedded in the Art file.   </p> <p></p> <p>When a capsule instance is created (this is sometimes referred to as capsule incarnation), it's state machine starts to execute by triggering the transition that goes out from the initial state (the big blue circle in the above diagram). Each state machine must have exactly one such initial state with an outgoing transition. Since this initial transition is triggered automatically when the capsule instance is created it cannot have any constraints like mentioned above. The initial transition is an example of a non-triggered transition since it cannot have triggers. </p> <p>The path from the source state to the target state can sometimes consist of more than one transition. In that case only the first of these is a triggered transition that may have triggers that specify when it will trigger. Once the first transition in this path has triggered, subsequent non-triggered transitions will always execute, one by another according to how they are connected in the state machine. However, also non-triggered transitions (with the exception of the initial transition) may have guards. Such guards are usually evaluated before the triggered transition triggers to ensure that they all are enabled, so that it's guaranteed that the target state can be reached. There is one exception to this rule, for transitions that leave a choice. Such guards are only evaluated once the choice has been reached to dynamically decide which outgoing transition to take next. This also means that guards of such transitions must be mutually exclusive, or there is a risk that the state machine will get stuck in the choice.</p> <p>In the state machine shown below the transitions <code>t2</code> and <code>t5</code> are triggered transitions, while other transitions are non-triggered. Transition <code>t5</code> can only be triggered if either the guard of <code>t7</code> or <code>t6</code> is true, while <code>t2</code> can be triggered even if neither the guard of <code>t3</code> nor <code>t4</code> is true. The target of transition <code>t5</code> is a junction which is used for either splitting or merging transition paths depending on evaluated guard conditions.</p> <p></p> <p>A state may be decomposed by a sub state machine. Such a state is called a composite state and a state machine that has composite states is called a hierarchical state machine. Transitions enter a composite state through an entry point and exit it through an exit point. </p> <p>Usually an entry point is connected to a nested state inside the state machine of the composite state, but it can also connect to a deep history. Reaching the deep history of a composite state means that all sub states that were previously active will become active again. Hence, deep history is a way to restore a composite state so all its nested states will be reactivated again recursively.</p> <p>The picture below shows a state machine with a composite state <code>Composite</code> containing two nested states <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code>. When this state machine starts to execute state <code>S1</code> first becomes active since <code>Composite</code> is entered using the <code>ep1</code> entry point. Later, when leaving <code>S2</code> through the <code>ex1</code> exit point, state <code>X</code> becomes active. Then when leaving <code>X</code> through the transition that connects to the <code>ep2</code> entry point the state <code>S1</code> once again becomes active since <code>ep2</code> is connected to the deep history. Of course, whenever a nested state is active, the enclosing composite state is also active. At any point in time a state machine has an active state configuration, which consists of the set of currently active states.</p> <p></p> <p>A state may have an entry action and/or exit action which is a C++ code snippet that gets executed whenever the state is entered or exited. Note that state entry actions for nested states also run when those states are entered because of a deep history. In state diagrams the presence of entry and/or exit actions are shown by icons just below the state name. In the state machine shown below state <code>S1</code> has an entry action, state <code>S2</code> has an exit action and state <code>S3</code> has both an entry and an exit action.</p> <p></p> <p>A transition where the source and target state is the same state is called a self-transition. A special kind of self-transition is an internal transition, which is a transition that when triggered doesn't leave the current state. Hence, when an internal transition is triggered the active state configuration remains unchanged, and neither the entry nor exit action of the state gets executed. In the state machine shown below the state has two self-transitions; <code>t</code> which is a regular self-transition (a.k.a. external self-transition) and <code>it</code> which is an internal transition. Since a state may have a large number of internal transitions they are not shown inside the state symbol, but if you select the state symbol you can see them in the Properties view. An icon is shown on those states that contain internal transitions.</p> <p></p> <p>State machines can not only be defined for capsules but also for regular classes. This can be useful if you want a plain passive C++ class to have a state machine. Contrary to a capsule a class may not have ports and doesn't execute in its own context. It's therefore common to associate such a class with a capsule that it can use for sending events through its ports. Transitions of a passive class state machine are triggered by calling trigger operations on the class. Such operations have no code, but just trigger transitions in the class state machine.</p> <p>The realtime application needs to designate one capsule as the top capsule. This is done in the transformation configuration, which is a file containing all the properties used for building the application (e.g. code generator options, compiler settings etc.). There is no language construct in Art for defining a top capsule; any capsule that you define can act as the top capsule.

When it receives the event it sent it can proceed with the next part of the big task.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application that uses a local binding here.</p>"},{"location":"art-lang/#part","title":"Part","text":"<p>A capsule can be decomposed by means of parts (also called \"capsule parts\" to emphasize that they are parts of a capsule). A part is a container that at run-time may hold one or many capsule instances. The part has a multiplicity that specifies the maximum number of capsule instances it can contain at run-time, and it has a type which is another capsule. All capsule instances must either be of that specific capsule type, or of a capsule type that inherits from it.</p> <p>It's common to name parts according to the capsule that types them. For example, a part typed by a capsule <code>Controller</code> may be called <code>controller</code>, <code>ctrl</code> or perhaps <code>theController</code>. By convention part names start with lowercase and use camelCase if the name consists of multiple words. </p> <p>There are three kinds of parts which determine how and when they will be populated with capsule instances.</p> <p>1) Fixed part</p> <p>In a fixed part capsule instances are created automatically when the container capsule is created, and destroyed when the container is destroyed. Fixed parts by default have multiplicity 1. Such a part will always contain one and only one instance of the capsule that types the part.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application that has a fixed part with a multiplicity here.</p> <p>2) Optional part</p> <p>In an optional part capsule instances don't have a strong lifetime relationship with the container capsule as is the case for fixed parts. The capsule instances can be created programmatically using a Frame port at some point after the container capsule has been created, and they can be destroyed before the container capsule is destroyed. However, at the latest they will be automatically destroyed when the container is destroyed. Optional parts by default have multiplicity 0..1. This means that they may either contain zero or one capsule instance at any point in time. The presence of zero in the multiplicity is what makes the part optional. Here is C++ code for creating a capsule instance in an optional part (also known as incarnating the part) and then immediately destroying it:</p> <pre><code>RTActorId id = frame.incarnate(thePart);\nif (!id.isValid()) {\n    // Failed to incarnate thePart\n}\nframe.destroy(id);\n</code></pre> <p>It's important to check that incarnation was successful since there are many reasons why it can fail (e.g. too low multiplicity to fit the created capsule instance, not enough memory etc). </p> <p>If the instantiated capsule has a constructor you need to use a capsule factory for providing the constructor arguments (either provided when doing the incarnation as shown here or specified on the part as described here).</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application that creates and destroys capsule instances in optional parts here.</p> <p>3) Plugin part</p> <p>A plugin part is similar to an optional part in that it is populated by capsule instances programmatically. However, the capsule instances are not created in the plugin part but instead imported into the plugin part from another part. Typically such a capsule instance is first created into an optional part, and then at some later point in time imported into a plugin part. Later it can be deported (i.e. removed) from the plugin part and perhaps imported into another plugin part. This makes it possible to create very dynamic composite structures where the same capsule instance can play different roles in different parts over time. Moving a capsule instance by deporting it from one plugin part and then importing it in another plugin part is more efficient than destroying the capsule instance in one optional part and then creating another capsule instance in another optional part. Plugin parts are typically used together with unwired ports. In general it's possible to import a capsule instance into more than one plugin part at the same time, but it can only be imported if its ports are not already bound in its current location. Plugin parts by default have multiplicity 0..1.</p> <p>In the example below the capsule <code>C</code> contains a few parts of different kinds and multiplicities. Note that you may declare multiple parts on the same line if they are of the same kind (both <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> below are optional parts).</p> <pre><code>capsule C {\n    part a : D;\n    fixed part b : D[4];\n    optional part c : D, d : D[0..5];\n    plugin part e : D;\n    part f : D[`COUNT`];\n\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Part <code>a</code> is fixed with multiplicity 1 since neither kind nor multiplicity is specified for it. Part <code>b</code> is also fixed (using the <code>fixed</code> keyword for more clarity) and with multiplicity 4. When an instance of capsule <code>C</code> is created 5 instances of capsule <code>D</code> will be automatically created. One of these instances will be inserted into part <code>a</code> and the others into part <code>b</code>. These instances will remain there until the <code>C</code> capsule instance is destroyed.</p> <p>Part <code>c</code> is optional with multiplicity 0..1. At run-time it can contain at most one instance of capsule <code>D</code>. Part <code>d</code> is also optional but can contain up to 5 instances of <code>D</code> as specified by its multiplicity 0..5.</p> <p>Part <code>e</code> is plugin with the default multiplicity 0..1. At run-time at most one instance of capsule <code>D</code> can be imported into it. That instance must already have been created in another part, for example part <code>c</code>.</p> <p>Part <code>f</code> uses a C++ expression for specifying the multiplicity. This can for example be useful if the multiplicity is defined in C++ as a macro, a template parameter or a constexpr.</p> <p>Parts can be shown in a structure diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>Parts are shown as \"stacked\" if they have non-single multiplicity (multiplicities specified with a C++ expression are assumed to be non-single). Optional parts are shown with a \"diagonal\" background pattern, while plugin parts are shown with a \"double diagonal\" background pattern.</p> <p>Parts can also be shown in a class diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>In the above diagram the filled diamonds show that there is a strong life-time relationship between a <code>C</code> instance and the instances of <code>D</code> that are located in the fixed and optional parts <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code> and <code>f</code>, while this is not the case for the instance located in the plugin part <code>e</code> as shown by the hollow diamond.</p>"},{"location":"art-lang/#part-with-capsule-factory","title":"Part with Capsule Factory","text":"<p>If the capsule that types a part has a capsule constructor with custom constructor parameters, you can define a capsule factory for the part.

This can be an alternative to using a capsule in case you only need a passive stateful data object, and don't need the ability to send events to it, or to let it execute in its own context. A class with a state machine is more lightweight than a capsule at runtime. </p> <p>Transitions in a class state machine are triggered by calling trigger operations on the class. A trigger operation is similar to a regular member function in C++, but does not have a code behavior of its own. Instead, when you call a trigger operation on an object of a class with a state machine it may trigger a transition in the class' state machine. That transition may have an effect code snippet that will execute.</p> <p>A trigger operation can have parameters which allows you to pass data when calling them. Those parameters can be accessed in the transition that is triggered by it.</p> <p>Below is an example of a class with a state machine with two trigger operations <code>initialize</code> and <code>finalize</code>. Note that you can define multiple trigger operations on the same line.</p> <pre><code>class DataObject {\n    /* Trigger Operations */\n    trigger initialize(`int` data), finalize();\n    /* State Machine */\n    statemachine {\n        state Initial, Initialized, Finalized;\n        initial -&gt; Initial;\n        init: Initial -&gt; Initialized on initialize(`int`)\n        `\n            // Initialized\n            int i = data;\n        `;\n        Initialized -&gt; Finalized on finalize()\n        `\n            // Finalized\n        `;\n    };\n};\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>Just like for C++ member functions, trigger operations support overloading. That is, you can have many trigger operations with the same name as long as their full signatures are unique. The signature of a trigger operation consists of its name and the types of all its parameters. When you reference a trigger operation with parameters as a transition trigger, you need to include the types of the parameters (see the trigger for the <code>init</code> transition above).</p> <p>The same transition can be triggered by multiple trigger operations (just like a transition in a capsule state machine can be triggered by multiple events). However, in that case those trigger operations should agree on the names and types of their parameters so that the transition effect code can access them in a way that works regardless of which of the trigger operations that will trigger the transition.</p> <p>Names of classes with state machines by convention start with uppercase, while names of trigger operations and their parameters by convention start with lowercase and use camelCase if the name consists of multiple words. </p> <p>A common design pattern is to let a class-with-statemachine instance be managed by a single capsule instance. This means that the capsule instance is responsible both for creating, using and finally destroying the class-with-statemachine instance. If you follow this pattern it is thread-safe to for example call public member functions defined on the capsule from a transition in the class state machine (or, better, to call non-public member functions by letting the class be a friend of the capsule). This can for example be used as a means for the class state machine to send events through the ports of the capsule (i.e. it can call a capsule member function that sends the event). However, to avoid exposing the full capsule functionality to the class state machine it's recommended to define an interface (i.e. abstract C++ class) which the capsule can implement. This interface can contain only those member functions which the class needs to call on the capsule.</p> <p>A class state machine can use the same constructs as a capsule state machine with a few exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The initial transition cannot access initialization data as can a capsule's initial transition. Instead you can define one or several constructors for the class with parameters needed for passing initialization data when the class-with-statemachine instance is created. See Constructor for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p>Frequent transitions are not supported.</p> </li> <li> <p>The state machine can be hierarchical but the deep history pseudo state is not supported. Instead the shallow history pseudo state can be used.</p> </li> <li> <p>Even if it's possible for a class with a state machine to inherit from another class with a state machine, this doesn't mean that the state machines will be inherited as is the case for capsule inheritance.

This is very similar to how inheritance works in C++, with the difference that in C++ a redefining element has more restrictions on what properties that can be changed in the redefined element.

One dimension is the usual C++ inheritance between classes (remember that a capsule is an active class). In this dimension it is for example possible to redefine (a.k.a override) a virtual member function defined in the base capsule or in another base C++ class. But there is also a second dimension where the state machine of the derived capsule will implicitly inherit from the state machine of the base capsule. This makes it possible to redefine transitions and states. For example, a redefining transition in a derived capsule can change the effect code, the guard condition or the target state or pseudo state. And a redefining state in a derived capsule can change the entry or exit action, as well as any substate or subtransition in case the state is composite and has a nested state machine. It's also possible to completely exclude a state or a transition, either in the top capsule state machine, or in a nested state machine.</p> <p>Below is an example of a capsule <code>D</code> that inherits from another capsule <code>B</code>.

For brevity the implementations of these functions have been omitted but would be placed in the <code>rt::impl</code> code snippet. <code>D</code> also overrides a virtual function <code>doSmth()</code> from the base capsule <code>B</code>. The implementation of that function (also placed in the <code>rt::impl</code> code snippet) calls the inherited function by using a macro <code>SUPER</code>. This macro expands to the name of the base capsule class. Using this macro, instead of the base capsule class name, makes it easier to copy/paste code from one capsule to another.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find a sample application where a capsule inherits from both another capsule and from C++ classes here.</p> <p>We can also see an example of a state machine redefinition. The initial transition <code>_Initial</code> of <code>B</code>'s state machine is redefined in <code>D</code>'s state machine so that it targets state <code>DS</code> instead of state <code>BS</code>. In the state diagram of <code>D</code> the state <code>BS</code> and the initial pseudo state are drawn with gray color and dashed outline, to show that they are inherited. The transition <code>_Initial</code> is also drawn with dashed outline, but with a different line style (\"dash-dot-dot\"), and with a green label to show that it's redefining the inherited initial transition. The state <code>BS2</code> is excluded in <code>D</code>'s state machine. In state diagrams excluded elements are shown with a \"crossed\" background.</p> <p></p> <p>Note that to be able to redefine the initial transition of <code>B</code> it is necessary to give it a name (so that it can be referenced as redefined from <code>D</code>). This is yet another reason why it's good practise to give names to transitions, even if it's not mandated. But, of course, if you want to prevent anyone from creating a derived capsule with a state machine that redefines a certain transition, you can accomplish that by not giving a name to that transition. In effect, an unnamed transition is final, i.e. cannot be overridden or excluded.</p> <p>The rule that a capsule state machine must have exactly one initial transition also applies to a derived capsule. Therefore, when you introduce inheritance between two existing capsules, you typically first get an error saying that the derived capsule has two initial transitions (one inherited, and one locally defined). You then need to decide if you want to either remove the initial transition in the derived capsule, or (like in the above example) instead redefine the initial transition.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>You can find sample applications where capsule state machines are inherited here:</p> <ul> <li>Redefining a transition effect</li> <li>Redefining a transition trigger</li> <li>Redefining a transition guard</li> <li>Excluding a transition</li> </ul> <p>Capsule inheritance also has a third dimension, which relates to its structure. Parts and ports defined in the base capsule are inherited by the derived capsule. Just like for states and transitions, it's possible to redefine or exclude a part or a port. A redefining port can change the type (i.e. protocol), multiplicity and the notification property of the redefined port. A redefining part can change the type, multiplicity and kind (fixed, optional or plugin) of the redefined part. </p> <p>Below is an example of a capsule <code>DPPI</code> that inherits from another capsule <code>BPPI</code>.

In the code shown below we assume the type descriptor describes a type called \"MyType\".</p> <p>1) A type descriptor object</p> <p>This is a variable typed by <code>RTObject_class</code> with a name that has the prefix \"RTType_\". It will be declared in the header file:</p> <pre><code>extern const RTObject_class RTType_MyType;\n</code></pre> <p>and implemented in the implementation file:</p> <pre><code>const RTObject_class RTType_MyType =\n{\n    // Initialization of RTObject_class corresponding to properties of MyType\n};\n</code></pre> <p>Member variables of RTObject_class store all information about the type, such as its name and byte size. Some of the member variables store pointers to type descriptor functions which the TargetRTS will call when it needs to do something with an instance of the type, for example copy or encode it.</p> <p>2) Type descriptor functions</p> <p>These are functions with a certain prototype, each of which performs a specific action on an instance of the type. The type descriptor object stores pointers to these functions. For a partial type descriptor, some of these pointers will be <code>nullptr</code> and then the corresponding type descriptor function does not exist. Below is the list of type descriptor functions that can be part of a type descriptor:</p> <p></p> Name Prototype Purpose init <code>void rtg_MyType_init(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target)</code> Initializes an instance of the type copy <code>void rtg_MyType_copy(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target, const MyType* source)</code> Copies one instance of the type (source) to another (target) move <code>void rtg_MyType_move(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target, MyType* source)</code> Moves one instance of the type (source) to another (target) destroy <code>void rtg_MyType_destroy(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target)</code> Destroys an instance of the type encode <code>void rtg_MyType_encode(const RTObject_class* type, const MyType* source, RTEncoding* coding)</code> Encodes an instance of the type decode <code>void rtg_MyType_decode(const RTObject_class* type, MyType* target, RTDecoding* coding)</code> Decodes an instance of the type <p>The encode function usually encodes the instance into a string representation, and the decode function usually parses the same string representation and creates an instance of the type from it. However, the functions use interface classes <code>RTEncoding</code> and <code>RTDecoding</code> from the TargetRTS which can be implemented in many different ways. Note also that you can globally disable the support for encoding and/or decoding by unsetting the macros <code>OBJECT_ENCODE</code> and <code>OBJECT_DECODE</code> respectively. </p> <p>3) A type installer object</p> <p>Decoding functions typically need to look up a type descriptor from the name of the type. For example, if it finds the type name \"MyType\" in the string that it parses, it needs to find the type descriptor object for \"MyType\" so it can allocate memory for an instance of \"MyType\" and then initialize it. To facilitate this lookup the TargetRTS keeps a type descriptor registry. The purpose of the type installer object is to add the type descriptor to this registry. The C++ code looks like this:</p> <pre><code>#if OBJECT_DECODE\nRTTypeInstaller rtg_MyType_installer( RTType_MyType );\n#endif\n</code></pre> <p>4) A \"typed value\" struct</p> <p>This is a struct which encapsulates an untyped instance of the type and its type descriptor. Its name has the prefix \"RTTypedValue_\". The struct has constructors that enable construction from a reference to an instance of the type.

This opens up for dynamic TC properties where the value of a property is computed at build-time. For simple cases it may be enough to replace static values for TC properties with JavaScript expressions to be able to build several variants of an application. As an example, assume that you want to either build a release or a debug version of an application. The debug version is obtained by compiling the code with the <code>$(DEBUG_TAG)</code> flag. The TC can then for example look like this:</p> <pre><code>let tc = TCF.define(TCF.CPP_TRANSFORM);\ntc.topCapsule = 'Top';\nlet system = Java.type('java.lang.System');\nlet isDebug = system.getenv('DEBUG_BUILD');\ntc.compileArguments = isDebug ? '$(DEBUG_TAG)' : '';\n</code></pre> <p>TCs are evaluated using Nashorn which is a JavaScript engine running on the Java Virtual Machine. This is why we can access a Java class such as <code>java.lang.System</code> to read the value of an environment variable. With this TC, and the use of an environment variable <code>DEBUG_BUILD</code>, we can now build either a release or a debug version of our application depending on if the environment variable is set or not.</p> <p>However, defining variants of an application like this can become messy for more complex examples. Setting up several environment variables in a consistent fashion will require effort for everyone that needs to build the application, and perhaps you even need to write a script to manage it. But the biggest problem is that the JavaScript that defines the build variants is embedded into the TC file itself. This makes it impossible to reuse a build variant implementation for multiple TCs. </p>"},{"location":"building/build-variants/#build-variants-script","title":"Build Variants Script","text":"<p>A Build Variants script allows to define build variants outside the TC itself. It defines a number of high-level settings, we call them build variant settings, each of which is implemented by a separate JavaScript file. There are two kinds of build variant settings that can be defined:</p> <ol> <li>Boolean settings These are settings that can either be turned on or off. The \"debug\" flag we implemented in the example above is an example of a boolean setting.</li> <li>Enumerated settings These are settings that can have a fixed set of values. A list of supported target platforms could be an example of an enumerated setting.</li> </ol> <p>A Build Variants script must have a global function called <code>initBuildVariants</code> which defines the build variant settings. Here is an example where one boolean and one enumerated build variant setting are defined:</p> <pre><code>// Boolean setting\nlet isDebug = {\n    name: 'Debug',\n    script: 'debug.js',\n    defaultValue: false,\n    description: 'If set, a debug version of the application will be built'\n};\n\n// Enumerated setting\nlet optimization = {\n    name: 'Optimization',\n    alternatives: [\n      { name: 'HIGH',  script: 'opt.js', args: ['HIGH'],  description: 'Apply all optimizations', defaultValue: true },\n      { name: 'MEDIUM',  script: 'opt.js', args: ['MEDIUM'],  description: 'Apply some optimizations'},\n      { name: 'OFF', script: 'opt.js', args: ['OFF'], description: 'Turn off all optimizations' }\n    ]\n};\n\n// This function defines which build variant settings that are applicable for a certain TC\nfunction initBuildVariants(tc) {\n    BVF.add(isDebug);\n    BVF.add(optimization);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note the following:</p> <ul> <li>The <code>name</code> property specifies a user-friendly name of the build variant setting.</li> <li>Use the <code>description</code> property to document what the build variant setting means and how it works.</li> <li>In case of an enumerated setting, exactly one of the alternatives should have the <code>defaultValue</code> property set. This alternative will be used in case no value is provided for that build variant setting at build-time. For a boolean setting, <code>defaultValue</code> should be set to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending on if you want the build setting to be turned on or off by default.</li> <li>The <code>script</code> property specifies the JavaScript file that implements the build variant setting. The path is relative to the location of the Build Variants script (usually they are all placed in the same folder). For a boolean setting the script is only invoked if the setting is set to <code>true</code>. For an enumerated setting the script is always invoked, and the value of the enumerated setting is passed as an argument to the script using the <code>args</code> property. It's therefore possible (and common) to implement all alternatives of an enumerated setting with the same script.</li> </ul> <p>The <code>initBuildVariants</code> function gets the built TC as an argument. You can use it for defining different build variant settings for different kinds of TCs.

Therefore you cannot access the TC in this function. The only input to the function is the script arguments, as defined by the <code>args</code> property for an enumerated setting. The main reason for implementing a <code>preProcess</code> function is to compute some data based on a build variant setting. Such data can be stored globally and later be accessed when <code>postProcess</code> gets called or in a TC file when setting the value of a TC property. Here is an example:</p> <pre><code>function preProcess( targetPlatform ) {\n    MSG.formatInfo(\"Building for target platform %s\", targetPlatform);\n    TCF.globals().targetPlatform = targetPlatform;\n    if (targetPlatform == 'Win64_MSVS') {\n        TCF.globals().targetCompiler = 'MSVS';\n        MSG.formatInfo(\"Building with Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler\");       \n    } else {\n        TCF.globals().targetCompiler = 'GCC';       \n        MSG.formatInfo(\"Building with GNU Compiler\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Here we use the <code>MSG</code> object for printing messages to the build log and we use the <code>TCF</code> object for storing globally some data that we have computed based on the build variant setting.

The function gets the built TC as an argument, as well as all its prerequisite TCs. For an enumerated setting it also gets the script arguments as defined by the <code>args</code> property. The function can directly modify properties of both the built TC and all its prerequisites. The property values that the TCs have when the function returns are the ones that will be used in the build. Hence this function gives you full freedom to customize all TC properties so that they have values suitable for the build variant setting. Here is an example that uses the global data computed in the <code>preProcess</code> function above:</p> <pre><code>function postProcess(topTC, allTCs, targetPlatform) {   \n    for (i = 0; i &lt; allTCs.length; ++i) {\n      if (TCF.globals().targetCompiler == 'MSVS') {\n        allTCs[i].compileCommand = 'cl';\n      }\n      else if (TCF.globals().targetCompiler == 'GCC') {\n        allTCs[i].compileCommand = 'gcc';\n      }\n\n      if (targetPlatform == 'MacOS') {\n        MSG.formatWarning(\"MacOS builds are not fully supported yet\");    \n      }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Also in this function we can use the <code>TCF</code> and <code>MSG</code> objects to access global data and to print messages to the build log. But most importantly, we can directly write the properties of the <code>topTC</code> (the TC that is built) and/or <code>allTCs</code> (the TC that is built followed by all its prerequisite TCs). </p> <p>By modifying the compileArguments TC property the build variant setting script can set preprocessor macros in order to customize the code that gets compiled. Hence we can both customize how the application is built, and also what it will do at run-time.

Read more about this feature in the documentation.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now supports local bindings (i.e. a connector between two behavior ports on the same capsule). This makes it possible for a capsule to send events to itself. Read more about this feature here.</li> <li>The support for state machine inheritance in the C++ code generator has been much improved. For an example, see this sample.</li> <li>Two new validation rules were implemented for checks related to ports. See ART_0034_servicePortWithoutEvents and ART_0035_timerServicePort.</li> <li>The C++ code generator now performs additional validation of an Art file when it's translated to C++.
