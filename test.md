# RTist in Code - Community Edition

This extension lets you develop event-driven, stateful, realtime applications in C++. Use the Art language and graphical diagrams, such as state charts, to work at a higher abstraction level than C++ code and with more automation.

**NOTE!**
On December 12, 2023, the first version of [Code RealTime](https://secure-dev-ops.github.io/code-realtime) was released. Thereby the RTist in Code beta program is now over. Please download and use Code RealTime instead of this extension!
