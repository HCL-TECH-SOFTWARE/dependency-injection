# RTist in Code

RTist in Code lets you create stateful, event-driven realtime applications in C++. It runs as an extension of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Eclipse Theia](https://theia-ide.org/). Learn everything about RTist in Code from its [documentation site](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/rtist-in-code/art-lang/).

RTist in Code is currently in an open beta phase and you are encouraged to [try it out](#). All feedback is appreciated and can be submitted as Issues in this repo.

As a starting point this repo contains a few [samples](art-samples) that you can use for learning the Art language and RTist in Code.

See the screen shot below for an overview of what RTist in Code can do.
